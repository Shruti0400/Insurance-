# Insurance Dataset

#### About the Project
This project explores a simple linear regression model, analyzing the relationship between an individual's age and their insurance premium. The objective is to understand how age influences insurance costs and to build a predictive model for estimating premiums based on age.

#### About the Dataset
The dataset contains age and premium details, enabling the analysis of:

- Age Impact – Understanding how age affects insurance premium pricing.
- Premium Trends – Identifying patterns in insurance premium amounts.
- Regression Modeling – Using simple linear regression to predict insurance costs based on age.

#### Key Features of the Dataset

- Age & Premium Data
- Age – Represents the individual's age.
- Premium – Represents the insurance premium amount paid by the individual.

#### Objectives of the Analysis

- Identify the correlation between age and insurance premium.
- Build a simple linear regression model for prediction.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the model using statistical measures.

#### Tools & Libraries Used

- Python – For data analysis and model building.
- Pandas – For data manipulation and processing.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn – For building and evaluating the regression model.
- Jupyter Notebook – For interactive analysis and exploration.

#### Key Findings & Insights

- The dataset shows a clear positive correlation between age and insurance premium.
- Linear regression modeling helps predict premiums based on age effectively.
- Visualizing the data confirms a trend where premiums increase with age.

#### Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into insurance premium determination and how age influences cost estimation. The regression model can be utilized for premium prediction, aiding insurance companies in pricing strategies and policy recommendations.
